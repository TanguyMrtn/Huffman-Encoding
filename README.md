How to run the program :

You can use this Huffman encoding in 2 ways : static or semi-adaptativ.
Run the program Main, follow the consol instructions (the file you want to encode MUST own a Unix line ending (LF), you can change it in
many text editor, Sublim Text for exemple).

Possible improvement : 
    -change the Huffman tree depth first search recursive method in iterativ because the program is taking to much time 
to get character binary codes.
    -allow the Windows line ending (CRLF), easy to do
    - what you want
